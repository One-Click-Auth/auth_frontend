# React + Vite Skeleton

## Contributing Guide

- Make a fork of the repo
- Clone your forked repo locally `git clone <repo_link>`
- `cd` into the cloned directory
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Create an upstream to the main repo `git remote add upstream https://github.com/One-Click-Auth/auth_frontend`
- To update your fork with the main repo run `git pull upstream dev`. Make sure you update your repo regularly to keep up with the main repo.
- Create a new branch `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- Run `npm run dev` and start developing

**Note:** Always make PRs to the `dev` branch and **NOT** the `main` branch
